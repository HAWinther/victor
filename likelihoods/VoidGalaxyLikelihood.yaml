params:
  # there are multiple possible combinations of parameters that might be used by the likelihood depending on
  # the settings and the model chosen; here all parameters are mentioned but the values of several of them are
  # deliberately left undefined in order to avoid inadvertently fixing them for a run where it might cause undetected
  # problems
  # For these undefined parameters, if you want to run a Cobaya chain you must define them (as sampled/derived/fixed)
  # in the input yaml. Even if you are not using them in some run, it is better to define them in the input yaml and
  # fix them to some arbitrary value anyway, otherwise GetDist will complain when processing the chain outputs.
